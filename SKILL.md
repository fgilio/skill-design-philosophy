# Skill Design Philosophy

Philosophy and principles only. Toolchain-specific quirks and implementation details belong in their respective skill docs (e.g., [php-cli-builder](../php-cli-builder/SKILL.md)).

**Goal**: Create skills that eliminate errors by design. Users should never encounter tool quirks - scripts handle everything internally.

Official docs: https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Zero-Error by Design

The skill should make it impossible to fail due to underlying tool quirks. If a CLI needs `--description` not `--body`, the script uses the right flag. If URLs need encoding, the script encodes them. Users never see the complexity.

This includes validating early: check dependencies, inputs, and formats before doing any work. If an external API changed its response shape, the script should fail with a clear message - not silently produce garbage.

```bash
# Bad: User needs to know about URL encoding
api projects/org%2Frepo/merge_requests/123

# Good: Script handles it
skill-mr-view org/repo 123
```

```bash
# Validate before doing anything
command -v tool >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo '{"error": "tool not installed"}' >&2; exit 1; }
[[ "$PROJECT" =~ ^[^/]+/[^/]+$ ]] || { echo '{"error": "Invalid project format"}' >&2; exit 1; }
```

For scripts that create resources or trigger side effects, consider idempotency. A "create MR" script invoked twice shouldn't create duplicates.

### 2. Intuitive Interfaces

Commands should read naturally and not require memorization. Sensible defaults eliminate unnecessary arguments - target branch defaults to `main`, filters default to the most common case (`open` not `all`).

```bash
# Good: Reads naturally, obvious what it does
skill-mr-create org/project "Fix bug" --description "Details"

# Bad: Requires knowing tool internals
tool mr create --repo org/project --title "Fix bug" --description "Details" --target-branch main --yes
```

**Naming convention**: Prefix scripts with skill name for global access: `{skill-name}-{resource}-{action}` (e.g., `gitlab-mr-create`, `browser-screenshot`). This prevents namespace collisions when scripts are in PATH.

### 3. Predictable Output

Two rules:
- **stdout** is for the consumer (Claude or a pipe). JSON for data operations, plain text for logs/traces.
- **stderr** is for problems. JSON errors with exit 1. Usage help with exit 1.

Never mix formats within a script. Never return nothing - use an empty JSON array if there are no results.

```bash
# Bad: Inconsistent contract
script1  # returns JSON
script2  # returns "Success!"
script3  # returns nothing

# Good: Consistent contract
script1  # returns JSON
script2  # returns {"status": "created", "id": 42}
script3  # returns [] (empty array)
```

```bash
# Good error (JSON to stderr)
{"error": "Invalid project format. Use: org/project"}

# Bad error
Error: something went wrong
```

### 4. Self-Contained Scripts

Each skill is a self-contained unit. No external package dependencies, no build steps.

Share code within a skill freely (e.g., a `lib.ts` for auth and validation). Never share code between skills - copy patterns instead. Each script owns its entry point with its own usage/help and argument parsing.

---

## Script Template

The rhythm every script follows. For a full working example, see `~/.claude/skills/gitlab/scripts/`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# [One-line description]
# Usage: skill-resource-action <required> [optional]
# Handles: [what quirks this abstracts away]
set -e

# Check dependencies
# Usage guard
# Parse + validate args
# Set defaults
# Do the work (handle quirks internally)
# Output JSON
```

TypeScript skills follow the same shape but run via `bun run` with no npm dependencies beyond Bun builtins.

### Handling Errors

API calls can fail. Don't let raw errors leak through:

```bash
RESPONSE=$(command "endpoint" 2>&1) || {
  jq -n --arg msg "Request failed: $RESPONSE" '{"error": $msg}' >&2
  exit 1
}

# Validate response is valid JSON before processing
echo "$RESPONSE" | jq -e . >/dev/null 2>&1 || {
  jq -n '{"error": "Invalid response"}' >&2; exit 1
}

echo "$RESPONSE" | jq '{id, name}'
```

### Pagination

Most APIs paginate by default. For complete results, use the tool's pagination flag or set `per_page` explicitly. Be careful with unbounded pagination on large datasets.

## Project Structure

### Directory layout

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: primary reference for Claude Code and humans
├── SPEC.md               # Optional: collaborative spec (kept after implementation)
├── reference.md          # Optional: deep documentation (or references/ directory)
├── package.json          # TypeScript only: bin field for global access via `bun link`
└── scripts/
    ├── setup.md              # Optional: human installation guide
    ├── lib.ts                # TypeScript only: shared infra within this skill
    └── skill-resource-action # The actual scripts
```

### Global access

Skills with scripts should be installable for global CLI access:

**TypeScript (Bun):** Add `bin` field to `package.json`, then `bun link`. Commands go to `~/.bun/bin/`.

**Bash:** Symlink scripts to `~/.local/bin/`:
```bash
for script in ~/.claude/skills/skill-name/scripts/skill-*; do
  ln -sf "$script" ~/.local/bin/$(basename "$script")
done
```

### SKILL.md frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name          # lowercase, hyphens only
description: >
  [What it does].
  [When to use it].
  Trigger words: [comma-separated keywords].
---
```

## Checklist for New Skills

### Before Building
- [ ] Identify the underlying tool's quirks and pain points
- [ ] List common operations users need
- [ ] Design intuitive command signatures

### Documentation
- [ ] SKILL.md with clear usage examples
- [ ] Comment in each script explaining what quirks it handles
- [ ] `reference.md` or `references/` directory if raw API/tool docs would be useful

### Testing
- [ ] Happy path works
- [ ] Validation errors return clean JSON
- [ ] Edge cases handled (empty results, special chars)
